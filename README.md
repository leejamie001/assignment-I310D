The goal of my project was to collect, process, and analyze and publish a dataset on dataworld
My data was found on Wikipedia at this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population and they have a GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)
I used the first table "List of United States cities by Population" and deleted columns 2021rank, 2021estimate, Change, 2020 population density.1, 2020 land area.1, and Location. I modified the data in 2020 Land Area and 2020 Population Density to be integers instead of strings.
In my analysis steps I was trying to show the disparities in the population between the top cities in the United States as well as how Land Area affected population
